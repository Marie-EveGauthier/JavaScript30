### Notes


#### Canvas API

> Every canvas element exists in two worlds and two forms:
> - the `<canvas>` tag, i.e. the `<canvas>...</canvas>` structure which is part of the HTML code
>
>  - the HTMLCanvasElement object, which is a proper JavaScript object and contains another  so-called context object, where the actual picture elements are generated.

#### HTMLCanvasElement

The HTMLCanvasElement interface provides **properties** and **methods** for manipulating the layout and presentation of `<canvas>` elements.
