### 17 - Sort without articles

My solution is much more verbose than Wes solution.

I asked ChatGPT 3.5 to compare both.... and it made a mistake in this explantion :(
But it was able to correct it after I pointed it....

Here our conversation :

**You**
Could you compare these 2 functions used to sort the name without the articles and find the pro and the cons of each one and eventually which one is the best solution

**ChatGPT**
Let's analyze both functions:

##### Wes Function:
1. **Pros**:

  - It uses a regular expression to remove common articles like "a," "an," and "the" from the beginning of band names.
  - It uses a single `sort()` function call, making the code concise.

2. **Cons**:

  - It creates a new array every time the `strip()` function is called, potentially impacting performance if used with large datasets.
  - It doesn't handle cases where band names have articles in different cases (e.g., "The" vs. "the").

##### My Function:
1. **Pros**:
  - It creates an array of objects with both the complete band name and the name without articles, allowing for easier debugging and understanding of the sorting process.
  - It uses a more explicit sorting approach, separating the process into mapping, sorting, and mapping back.

2. **Cons**:
- It involves more steps and operations than the first function, potentially impacting performance, especially with large datasets.
  - It's more verbose and may be harder to read and maintain, especially for developers unfamiliar with the code.

#####  Comparison and Recommendation:
Both functions achieve the same goal of sorting band names without articles. The first function (wes one) is more concise and straightforward, using a regular expression for article removal and a single `sort()` call. ~However, it may have some limitations in handling case sensitivity and performance with large datasets.~ _(THIS IS FALSE -- see later in the conversation)_

The second function (mine) is more explicit in its approach and provides additional information about the bands, which can be useful for debugging. However, it involves more steps and operations, potentially impacting performance and readability.

In conclusion, for smaller datasets or when performance is not a significant concern, the second function may provide better readability and debugging capabilities. However, for larger datasets or when performance is critical, the first function would be a more efficient choice due to its simplicity and concise nature.

**You**
The first function uses this regular expression : `bandName.replace(/^(a |the |an )/i, '').trim();`
Is not the `i` at the end used for handling case sensitivity ?

**ChatGPT**
You're correct. My apologies for the oversight. The `i` flag in the regular expression `/^(a |the |an )/i` indeed stands for case insensitivity. This flag ensures that the regular expression matches regardless of whether the letters are uppercase or lowercase.

So, in the context of the `strip()` function in this function, the `/i` flag ensures that it matches article prefixes such as "a", "an", or "the" regardless of their case in the band names.

Thank you for pointing out the clarification!
