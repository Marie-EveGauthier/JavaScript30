# 06 - Type Ahead

### Topics covered
- fetch API
- event listener: change and keyup

### Notes
- Fetch is promise-based
- `querySelectorAll`` method returns a **static** list. Any changes made to the document after the querySelectorAll is used (like removeChild in the case I try to resolve) will not be reflected in the list of nodes returned.
